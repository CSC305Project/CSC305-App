Metric 1: NPS (Net Promoter Score)
   - To calculate this metric, we will use the results from our customer survey asking how likely they are to recommend
     our product to a friend. From these results, we will subtract the perentage of detractors from the percent of the promotors,
     and use that as our NPS score.
     
Metric 2: CTR (Click Through Rate)
   - Track when a user has landed on a page that has an option go to to a next, then track how many times that next page is reached, then compute the %

Metric 3: Adoption
   - To track adoption a good technique for this is tracking the number of download we are getting compared to similar releases in the market space.
