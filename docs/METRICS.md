Metric 1: NPS (Net Promoter Score)
   - To calculate this metric, we will use the results from our customer survey asking how likely they are to recommend
     our product to a friend. From these results, we will subtract the perentage of detractors from the percent of the promotors,
     and use that as our NPS score.
