#Market place speech

We picked 'Fine Wallet as an official market place template in FlutterFlow.
Though we didn't copy it word for word, it did give us the main inspiration needed for a basic finance app.
After taking inspiration from that, we made a template in figma based on a template figma mainly generated for us.
The problems we ran into was whether our logo would fit into the borders of the app, what our color scheme would be,
and how similar this would be to other financal apps. We resolved these problems by stcking to a theme,
changing the UI ,and color scheme so it wouldn't be super similar to other  finance apps. The component made the work so easy
we barely had to do anything that so time consuming.
