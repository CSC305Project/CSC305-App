Observation 1: 
  Observation Statement: Many People say that they are confident in their spending, however many responses said they didn't track spending
  Supporting Data: 32/63 responses say they don't track spending, while 49.2% of responses gave a 4 star rating for how confident they were in their financial decisions 
  Team Action (if any): For our Business anouncement, we should say how many people are confident they are good with money/good spenders, however they are not properly 
    tracking their expenses.
Observation 2:
Though our application will mainly be the same, there are some changes we would want to make as to not be similar to competitors like rocket money or cashapp. We could add a suggestion AI that let's you know if what your buying would be a smart purchase or not. Supporting Data is mainly what we discussed today, we mentioned a barcode, we mentioned security similar to DUO mobile, and create a feed to let everyone know globally of your progress. If it's a feature that can differ from competitors, it would be viable. Team Action is on hold for now as we haven't started building the app.
