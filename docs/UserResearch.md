Observation 1: 
  Observation Statement: Many People say that they are confident in their spending, however many responses said they didn't track spending

  Team Action (if any): For our Business anouncement, we should say how many people are confident they are good with money/good spenders, however they are not properly 
    tracking their expenses.
    
Observation 2:
Though our application will mainly be the same, there are some changes we would want to make as to not be similar to competitors like rocket money or cashapp. We could add a suggestion AI that let's you know if what your buying would be a smart purchase or not. Supporting Data is mainly what we discussed today, we mentioned a barcode, we mentioned security similar to DUO mobile, and create a feed to let everyone know globally of your progress. If it's a feature that can differ from competitors, it would be viable. Team Action is on hold for now as we haven't started building the app. 

Observation 3:
  Most users' financial goals are to be financially stable and to be able to save up for larger goals such as their child/children's tuition, saving for a house, a car, etc. 
  Supporting Data: We received 63 responses and most of these responses were to be financially stable.
  Team Action: Show the team the majority goals that are most important to users so that it can help us create our AI chat bot to take these goals into consideration.

Observation 4: 
  Observation Statement: Over 50% of responders are currently saving for something on their horizon
  Supporting Data: We see that often people are saving for a car, rent, house, with a couple saying they invest, or are saving for retirement 
  Team Action (if any): We can focus outselves more at the importance of investing and saving, and how much they could benefit. Also make it intuitive to track your progress towards saving for an item and give reccomendations based on their accounts to predict how much per time perioud they should put towards that goal.
